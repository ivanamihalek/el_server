Starting ExoLocator:

* mysql must be running (sudo mysqld_safe)
* sudo ./play start



----------------------------------------------------------------
Things which need to be changed when adding new species:

* The file app/util/GeneQuery.java needs to be modified.
* A file Exon_[spec_name].java has to be created in app/models, 
  templated on the exiting files of other species.
